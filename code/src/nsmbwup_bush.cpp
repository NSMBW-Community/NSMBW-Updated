// Patches for Bush (daObjFruitTree_c): sprite 387, profile 561
// (OBJ_FRUITTREE).


#ifndef NSMBWUP_C00900_OFF

// The Bush sprite just uses the default single-tile spawn range instead
// of configuring it to fit the actor's actual shape. This works fine at
// the default "small" size, but with any of the larger size settings,
// this can cause severe pop-in when approached from above.

// We fix this by simply increasing the spawn range vertically. The
// largest bush size is about 4 tiles (aka 64 units) taller than the
// default, so we increase it by that much.

kmWrite32(0x8030dfc8, 64);  // Move spawn range 4 tiles up
kmWrite32(0x8030dfd4, 64);  // Increase spawn range height by 4 tiles
