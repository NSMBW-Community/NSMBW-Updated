#ifndef NSMBWUP_C00200_OFF

// The game actively moves upside-down switches left by one unit (1/16
// of a tile) upon spawn. This doesn't appear to serve any useful
// purpose, and just makes them look slightly wrong.

// This behavior can also be found in NSMBDS. If it had some reason to
// exist in that game, it's probably unlikely (but admittedly not
// impossible) that it still does here.
