// Patches for Event-Controlled Cameras, aka Camera Profiles.


#ifdef NSMBWUP_C00300

// When using camera mode 5 (event-controlled), the game only switches
// camera modes if the new camera-profile struct would have a different
// index from the current one. Otherwise it refuses to switch to the new
// profile, even if its event is activated.

// Unfortunately, it initializes the attribute that keeps track of the
// current camera profile index to 0 instead of -1. So if you try to
// activate the first profile first, it won't work because the game
// incorrectly thinks it's already using that one. You need to switch to
// the second or higher profile first, and only then can the first
// profile be used.

// Reggie works around this issue by inserting a dummy camera profile
// into the first slot, with the event ID set to 0 so it can never be
// activated. But it's still nice to have the bug, and fix, documented.
