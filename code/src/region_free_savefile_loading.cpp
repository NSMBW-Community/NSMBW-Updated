// The first four bytes of the savegame file, wiimj2d.sav, are the game
// ID -- for example, "SMNP" for PAL NSMBW, or "SMNE" for US NSMBW.
// This is checked when the file is loaded. Unfortunately, this ties
// savegames to specific regions, even though in practice there are no
// other differences between different regions' savegames.

// The bytes are checked one by one in dNandThread_c::load(). This patch
// nops out the check for the fourth byte, so that files from any
// region will pass the validation.
