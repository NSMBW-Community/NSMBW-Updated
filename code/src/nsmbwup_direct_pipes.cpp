// Thanks to Ninji (Treeki) for this patch.

// daPlBase_c::initializeState_DemoRailDokan() is responsible for
// starting a direct-pipes player movement animation. This involves
// initializing a daPlBase_c field unofficially known as
// "nextPathNodeIndex", to either "1" or "path->numNodes - 2" depending
// on the entrance's "direct pipe reversed" flag (which makes the player
// follow the path backward from the end). It also checks that first
// node's position, to set the first target position for the player to
// linearly slide to.

// Unfortunately, though, it performs those two operations in the wrong
// order: it uses a *stale* value of "nextPathNodeIndex" to get the
// pointer to the first path node, before initializing it right after.
// This means the first path node may be anything: usually it's the
// first one in the area (index 0) the first time a player uses a
// direct-pipe entrance, and then some other, often invalid value for
// subsequent direct-pipe traversals. This frequently results in the
// player traveling to their death somewhere outside of the zone
// boundaries.

// To summarize, the function does

//     lvlRailNode *firstNode = area->pathNodesBlock[
//         path->startNodeIndex + this->nextPathNodeIndex];
//     this->nextPathNodeIndex = (destEntrance->flags & 0x0001)
//         ? (path->numNodes - 2) : 1;

// and the order of those two lines needs to be swapped.

// To do this, we simply overwrite that block of code with essentially
// the same assembly instructions, shuffled into the correct order.

// to know what direction the exit pipe faces.

// It does this by checking the entrance's type. Unfortunately, though,
// it uses the wrong entrance for this -- specifically, the one the
// player *entered*, rather than its *destination*.

// We fix this by hooking on the instruction that calls
// dCdFile_c::getNextGotoP() (which gets the pointer to an entrance,
// given its ID) and replacing it with a new function that recreates
// that call and also adds another to get the pointer to *that*
// entrance's destination. This second pointer is then used for the
// type/direction check.

// We ignore the first entrance's destination-area value. While it
// really ought to match the current area ID, there isn't any useful
// behavior we could do if it doesn't.

// daPlBase_c::setExitRailDokan(), called at the end of direct-pipes
// animations, switches the player to the correct animation state for
// exiting from the end of the pipe. Specifically, it checks the
// destination entrance's (or the *source* entrance's, if bug C01200
// isn't fixed) type value -- which indicates the pipe direction -- and
// sets the player's "demo" (cutscene) state to one of
// daPlBase_c::StateID_DemoInDokanU, D, L, or R.

// But due to what can only be a typo, it uses StateID_DemoInDokanU for
// *both* of the vertical pipe directions, and never uses
// StateID_DemoInDokanD. The state ID names are a bit unintuitive: this
// bug makes the player exit from upward-facing pipes in the downward
// direction.

// We fix this by replacing the instruction that loads the wrong StateID
// address with some code that loads the right one.

// Implementation note: for each game version in isolation, this can be
// done by replacing a single instruction, but since that instruction
// uses an offset from an arbitrary address (in r31) that was calculated
// earlier in the function, this method should be somewhat safer and
// more robust against different builds of the game with different
// memory layouts.

// Implementation note 2: Newer SMBW works around this bug by instead
// encoding "direction of other side" as a new setting in byte 0x13 of
// the NextGoto struct. That byte is never referenced at all in the
// original game, and that fix clearly doesn't match the intent of the
// original code, which checks entrance types. The fix presented here is
// more correct, but may not work with certain levels that expect
// Newer's version.
