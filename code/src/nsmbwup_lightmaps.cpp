// Patches for EGG's custom system for dynamically generated lightmaps.


#ifndef NSMBWUP_C00400_OFF

// Thanks to Skawo and Ninji for this patch.

// Dynamically generated lightmap materials are set to nearest-neighbor
// filtering rather than linear, resulting in pixelated-looking
// reflections on models when played in Dolphin with increased internal
// resolution.

// Here, we patch EGG::LightTexture::draw() to force the
// EGG::CpuTexture's minFilter and magFilter fields to 5
// (Linear_Mipmap_Linear) and 1 (Linear) respectively, just before
// they're drawn.

// A better solution would be to patch these values when they're
// initialized in EGG::LightTexture::initialize() (see P1: 802cbe5c).
// Unfortunately, that function runs before the Kamek loader, so that
// doesn't work with the current loader setup.
