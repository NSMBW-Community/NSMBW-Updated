// Patches for Bowser's Castle Boss Room Door (daEnKoopaDoor_c): sprite
// 452, profile 233 (EN_KOOPADOOR).


#ifdef NSMBWUP_C00700

// Thanks to Grop for this patch.

// When Mario enters a door, he decides if the door is "wide" or not,
// which affects some details of his animation.

// If Mario isn't "close enough" to the center of a normal door, he'll
// automatically walk to the center before entering it. If he is, the
// walking animation will be skipped, and he'll just slide toward the
// center while walking away from the camera instead.

// Doors considered wide have a slightly larger radius for the "close
// enough to the center" range (5/8 of a tile instead of 1/2), and they
// omit the sliding behavior. (These changes take place in
// dAcPy_c::exeDemoOutDoor_OpenDoor() and
// dAcPy_c::exeDemoOutDoor_MoveInter() respectively.)

// dAcPy_c::setDoorDemo() classifies a door into one of the
// two categories. It considers tower (EN_TORIDEDOOR) and castle
// (EN_CASTLEDOOR) doors wide, and all others normal. It seems, however,
// that the developers forgot to consider the Bowser's Castle boss room
// door, which is the widest door in the game.

// This patch adjusts the condition to include this door in that
// category. Note that both the code being patched and the patch itself
// rely on the fact that these three profile IDs are sequential.
