# NSMBW-Updated

Just a collection of unofficial bugfixes for *New Super Mario Bros. Wii.* There isn't much here yet, but hopefully it'll gradually grow over time.

This project doesn't include anything from *Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii.* For that, go check out [NSMBWer](https://github.com/Danster64/NSMBWer).
