# NSMBW-Updated

A collection of unofficial bugfixes for *New Super Mario Bros. Wii.*

The goal is for this project to be all of the following:

* A standalone Riivolution patch that fixes as many mistakes in the base game as possible
* Detailed, high-quality documentation on those mistakes and how the fixes work
* A useful base code package that can be plugged into other mods of the game, replacing the previous status quo of perpetually copying the same few common patches from mod to mod
